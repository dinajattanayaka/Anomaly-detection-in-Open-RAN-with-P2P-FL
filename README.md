# Anomaly-detection-in-Open-RAN-with-P2P-FL

Four P2P FL models are considered.

Normal P2P FL model (TaregtEncod_Function)  - Uses sub total calculation of partital weights for averaging.
Clustered P2P FL model (Clustered_Function) - Clustered version of the Normal P2P FL model
Hierarchical P2P FL model (Hierarchical_Function) - Hierarchical clustered version of Normal P2P FL model
Homomorphic P2P FL model (Homomorphic_Function) - Uses homomorphic encrypted averaging
